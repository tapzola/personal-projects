# Overview

## Software Description

This is my own creation of a website that lists all the books that i have read.  This website will be able to view book list items, be able to edit a book's rating, be able to delete books from the database, be able to add new books via the add page. This list of books written will be sorted in descending order according to the rating. The higher the rating the higher up it will be in the list.  
 
## Purpose

As i read more books, i can always update my list and keep track of which books to recommend people.

# Development Environment

I used the Python programmming language together with SQLAlchemy. I did all of this using VS Code as my IDE.

For this software i used Flask as my web framework since it supports the python programming language.
This means flask provides tools, libraries and technologies that allow me to build a web application. Inside the Flask framework i used Jinja which is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. I have some html files i used in my software and Jinja renders those html files. Jinja is super helpful because it allowed me to write code in those html files that is similar to Python syntax.
Because i was using the Flask framework i imported SqlAlchemy so that i can use it in the software as well. SQLAlchemy is a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases.SQLAlchemy provides a nice “Pythonic” way of interacting with databases. So rather than dealing with the differences between specific dialects of traditional SQL such as MySQL or PostgreSQL or Oracle, you can leverage the Pythonic framework of SQLAlchemy to streamline your workflow and more efficiently query your data.
