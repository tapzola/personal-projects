# Overview

I used react.js to create my own to-do list, this to-do-list will be able to:
1: Create a task.
2: Mark task as complete
3: Edit a task's content.
4: Delete a task.


 No front-end library has grown as much as React has in such a short time. Since i already knew
 Javascript, HTML and CSS i thought it would be best to learn this library and expands my skills 
 in the front-end development environment.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my code editor.

I used React, a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  I used it because it lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.  I used HTML and CSS as well.
