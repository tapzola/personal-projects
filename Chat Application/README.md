# Overview

To demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript language I built a simple chat application that allows users to talk to each other in real-time. The application will consist of two separate components, a server, and a client. 

I have always thought that chat applications that send message to people all over the world are so cool. When i migrated to the United States i began to appreciate even more WhatsApp(which is much more than just a chat application) as i use i frequently to communciate with my family far away. I decided to create my own chat application as well.

# Development Environment

I used HTML and CSS for building and styling my chat application. 
I used Socket.io which is a JavaScript library that allows real-time communication between clients and servers. It's built on top of the Websockets API. Websockets and socket.io are beneficial because a user can receive messages or posts from other users without needing to refresh the page. I also used node.js as my backend programming language.
