# Overview


I created a quiz application. This application will interact with the user by prompting the user to input an answer to a question and checks if its correct. If the answer is correct it will highlight the answer green to show thatâ€™s its correct, When the answer is wrong, it will highlight
the answer red, and show the correct anwser highlighted in green. 


I created this quiz app because i love soccer, so i decided to create questions to see the knowlwdge people have about basic soccer questions about popular soccer players.

# Development Environment


I used Kotlin and Android Studio. I also used xml code to
structure the application and create my custom layout.
