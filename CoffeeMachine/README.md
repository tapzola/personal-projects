# Overview

I created a virtual  coffee machine program that is coin operated, can make 3 flavors, the coffee machine has some resources that it has to manage, it cannot make more coffee if the resources are not enough, it will check if the amount of coins put by the user is sufficient for the price of that specific coffee or not, it will deduct total resources available from the resources that make the specific type of coffee. 

I wrote this software to demonstrate my competency in understanding the C# language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio as my IDE to write this code. I used C# language to create this software.
s a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and it is familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript languages.

# Future Work

- Add emojis to my virtual machine so it looks better
- Ask the user the question again even if the resources are not enough instead of ending the code
